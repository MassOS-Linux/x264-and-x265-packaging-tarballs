# x264-and-x265-packaging-tarballs
Packaging tarballs for x264 and x265, as these packages are only available via git.

# Copyright
All these scripts do is `git clone` source repositories and `tar` them up. We really don't consider it substancial enough to need copyrighting. But if that is needed, consider it in public domain. Obviously the x264 and x265 packages have their own licenses which will apply to the distributed tarballs produced from these scripts (which should be inside the tarballs).

The developers of these scripts make no additional copyright claims to any part of the code of the x264 and x265 projects.
